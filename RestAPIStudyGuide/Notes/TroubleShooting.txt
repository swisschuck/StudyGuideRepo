+ Not getting responses back in postman (it just sits there)
	- check to make sure you have the [HttpGet()] attribute applied to your controller method.
	- check to make sure the URI for local host is correct:
		- DO NOT USE the local host value (http://localhost:44320/.....), open the launchSettings.json file under the project properties section to see what
		  correct URL should be:

		"iisExpress": {
			"applicationUrl": "http://localhost:54908",
			"sslPort": 44320
		}

		now change http://localhost:44320/ to http://localhost:54908 in postman or the browser and you should start to get a response back.
