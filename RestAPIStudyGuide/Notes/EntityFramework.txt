+ Entity framework is an ORM
+ Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) - is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm.

+ Industry problems that created the Entity Framework
	- Relation models and object models do not work well together
	- Tabular database format versus an interconnected object graph

+ Solutions that the EF provides
	- An ORM - the library that implements the object-relational mapping technique.
	- It takes care of mapping between that tabular format and the object graph.

+ Entity Framework Core
	- Entity framework core is a lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform version of the Entity Framework.
	- Recommended for newer applications that dont need the full EF6 feature set and programs like this one that are built with .NET Core.
	- It comes with a variety of databases, even non-relational ones.
	- can be used with Code-First or database-first approaches.

+ Entites
	- just simple objects that are used to define our data structure.

+ DBContext
	- Its simply a context to interact with our database. This context represents a session with the database, it can be used to save and query instances.


Migrations	
==================================================

+ allow us to save snapshots of our entities and the database scructure so we can revert back or just to have versions
+ we can create a new migration by first installing the nuget package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools. 
  After the install open the Package Manager Console and type: PM> Add-Migration <TheNameOfYourMigrationGoesHere>
+ if we want to update the database using our current snapshot we can open the Package Manager Console and type: PM> Update-Database
