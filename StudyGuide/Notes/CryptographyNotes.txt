Security Concepts
=======================
+ Confidentiality - the process of making data completely unreadable.
+ Inegrity - maintainig consistancy and accuracy throughout its entire lifecycle.
+ Non-Repudiation - the assurance that someone cannot deny the authenticity of the signature of a document/data.
+ Authentication - using a cryptographic system we can establish the identity of a user or system.


Random Numbers
========================
+ Used for Generating encryption keys.
+ Software based random numbers ares not truly random.
+ Randomness can be created from human interaction.
+ Not practical for server applications.
+ Can use dedicated hardware or a specfically designed algorithm.
+ Microsoft recommends creating 1 instance of System.Random to generate numbers for your application. However System.Random is not thread safe, if your
  application calls methods on the random objects from multiple threads you must use synchronization objects to ensure that only one thread can access the
  random number generator at a time.
+ The RNGCryptoServiceProvider class is a more secure way to generate random numbers and is thread safe but it tends to be slower to execute.
